Please give a short description of the following characteristics for your solution:

‚óè Will it work with a 2 TB input file as well?
    This Will not work for a 2TB Input File
    as I am reading the entire JSON File as one Object so it will fail due to Memory Error
    We could read the JSON File in Chunks to mitigate this issue
    but ourservice will fail as we will get blocked from our API Vendor as we would exceed our rate limit



3-  What would happen if the input file has one malformed JSON line towards the
end of the file?
   We would not be able to read the File 
   the better solution would be to fix the broken data at the source
   But if that is not an option we could use regex.


3 - Assume your API should degrade gracefully / still be available in case the
upstream exchange rate service is down. How would you handle this?
    I would use a Caching Mechanism to Store the latest Converted Values for one currency.
    and Convert to the requested currency by computing it based on the latest currency value
    By this i would reduce the number of calls to the API.
    This Cache would be refreshed Every X Minutes with the Latest Currency Prices
